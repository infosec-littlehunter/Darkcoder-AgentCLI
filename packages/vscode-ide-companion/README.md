# VS Code IDE Companion (Upstream: Qwen Code Companion)

This companion extension integrates with your VS Code workspace and can drive DarkCoder or the upstream [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code). It is compatible with both VS Code and VS Code forks.

# Features

- Open Editor File Context: The assistant gains awareness of the files you have open in your editor, providing a richer understanding of your project's structure and content.

- Selection Context: The assistant can access your cursor's position and selected text within the editor, giving it valuable context directly from your current work.

- Native Diffing: Seamlessly view, modify, and accept code changes suggested by the assistant directly within the editor.

- Launch Session: Quickly start a new session from the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) by running the "Qwen Code: Run" command (works with DarkCoder or Qwen Code).

# Requirements

To use this extension, you'll need:

- VS Code version 1.101.0 or newer
- DarkCoder CLI or Qwen Code (installed separately) running within the VS Code integrated terminal
